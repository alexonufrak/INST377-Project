        <h3>Information Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Choosing a place to live is a very big deal for everyone. For that reason there are
          many factors that people consider when deciding to settle in a place. One of the
          important factors is safety issues and emergency services available in the area.
          Homes near fire stations reduce those if not eliminate them. Houses near the fire
          stations can get faster emergency services and also there are less likely for
          crime to occur as there are people moving around all day. Our project will allow
          people to locate fire stations near them which they could use to determine which
          houses are close to the stations and which houses are not. It will also provide
          information on whether or not medical and ambulance service are available at
          that station and the type of station, volunteer or state run. Also knowing the
          location of the fire stations near their neighborhood could help people find shelter
          during disasters and where to seek help during emergency situations.

            The stakeholder for this project are people living in PG county as they would be
            able to see out help and or shelter during emergency time. New residents coming
            to PG county seeking for new residents can decide which house is the best when
            it comes to living near fire stations.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who are thinking about coming to live in PG county can use our system to
            figure out a place that could be viewed as a safe place to live without wasting too
            much time searching around or asking other people. Also people living in PG
            county could use our system to figure a place to seek emergency help and also
            find shelter during emergency time. We can rate the stations based on which
            ones provide both medical and ambulance services and the type of station,
            giving higher rank for state and county over volunteer.
