This application can also be helpful for determining the distance between current PG county residences' homes and the closest fire station, as well as the specific location of the station. This information can be useful in case of current or future emergencies. 

## Application Use
To use this system you need go on the home page, which is the intial page containing the map. All fire stations are displayed on the map as markers. The map can be zoomed in and out and moved around to see specific locations and adresses. There are filters that can be used to help refine which fire stations show up on the map. There are three different filters. One filter is for the presence of an ambulance, another is the presence of a medical unit, and the third filter is the type of stations it is (County, State, and Volunteer). There is also the option of typing in a specific address in the address search bar which will zoom in on that location and show the stations around it.

## Rating System
Each station has a rating out of five stars to help point out which station has more services available. The five star rating is determined by gaining one star if the station has an ambulance, one star if there is a medical unit and up to three stars based on the type of station. One star for volunteer, two stars for county and three stars for state run fire stations.
