The map can be zoomed in and out and moved around to see specific locations and adresses. There are filters that can be used to help refine which fire stations show up on the map. There are three different filters. One filter is for the presence of an ambulance, another is the presence of a medical unit, and the third filter is the type of stations it is (County, State, Volunteer). There is also the option of typing in a specific address in the address search bar which will zoom in on that location and show the stations around it.
