## Information Problem
The information problem we aimed to solve was finding optimal places to buy a home in PG county. We are looking specifically at safety and emergency service availability to determine which areas are optimal and which are not.
We chose the fire department as the emergency service to focus on. Not all fire stations provide the same services and are of the same quality
